# What is Abhyas (WEB)?
As you might already know abhyas is an awesome resource available for JEE/NEET aspirants to boost their test giving skills through quality mock test.

Since abhyas is limited to android only, this project aims to bridge that gap between different platforms by introducing a web version of abhyas.

Our aim is to mirror the original android app and possibly introducing more features that will help JEE aspirants.
